# README

This crate provides bindings for an approximate (fuzzy) regex matching engine based on the [TRE](https://github.com/laurikari/tre) regex library. Some code has been copied and adapted from [tre-regex-sys](https://github.com/Elizafox/tre-regex-sys) and [tre-regex](https://github.com/Elizafox/tre-regex) crates.
